            | Xenon is set in a fantasy world akin to a mystical wild west.
            | If you're not in a town, you and your friends are the law.
            | People don't just give you ammunition and supplies, you've got to make your own stuff to survive out there.
            | Albeit killing people isn't to be taken lightly, there can be serious repercussions;
            | somebody might want you down for killing their friend, you see.
            | Thankfully if you 'die', the spectral guardians will renew you at one of their obelisks.
            | They're here to keep the world in balance, and to make sure young whippersnappers don't destroy the world on a whim.
