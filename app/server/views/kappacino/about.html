I was sort of muscled into learning Flash because I had taken an animation course at Kutztown. Not exactly the worst thing to be muscled into, I suppose.</br></br>          It was originally a site to house my animations, featuring a fox named Kitsune and Atom Kappa, where the title of the site actually comes from. A Kappa is a japanese water monster. They&apos;re actually really nasty in mythology, but the Japanese have made them adorable.</br></br>          Anyway, as you can see, the animations are still here,  but this site has become more about featuring my comics and illustrations. A sort of web portal for my various art endeavors, I suppose.</br></br>          The next natural question is: Who AM I?</br>          Well, I&apos;m <b>Sara Miscavage</b> and I like to draw stuff. Anime and cartoons are my specialty.</br></br>          I&apos;m a <b>freelance illustrator</b> from not-so-sunny Pennsylvania, and I live with my husband and two cats. One is gray and named Shady. The other is named Ghost. He is white, deaf and clinically insane. But I love him. Cats are awesome. But this isn&apos;t about cats. It&apos;s about art.</br></br>          I&apos;ve been doing art for as long as I can remember. I loved it so much that I went to college for it and I graduated in 2000 with a bachelor degree in fine arts.</br></br>          After I graduated, I worked for 12 years at a full-service ad agency doing all things prepress, graphic design, illustration and animation. I learned quite a bit about design at my previous job, but after 12 long years, I decided that it was time for me to move forward and finally pursue a career in Illustration.</br></br>          Throughout the years, I have had the opportunity to work with clients all over the world, including local clients like EPSCO as well as clients across the country, such as WeLoveFine. I hope to continue to do Illustration as my career as long as I can. It is truly my passion.</br></br>          If you want to hire me, feel free to <a href="mailto:saramiscavage@gmail.com">email me</a>. I check my emails on a very regular basis. I will promise you this if you do decide to work on a project with me. I am fast and I am professional.
